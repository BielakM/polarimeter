# TNLC devevice
Our polarimeter (TNLC devevice) is composed of twisted nematic liquid crystal cells and control electronics.
## Liquid crystal cells
We use cells from the LUMEX LCD-S101D14TR display. The protective and polarizing layers must be removed from the displays. The LCD datasheet is available in [LUMEX LCD-S101D14TR datasheet](https://github.com/BielakM/polarimeter/tree/master/LUMEX%20LCD-S101D14TR%20datasheet).
## Printed circuit board
Eagle schematic for printed circuit board of the TNLC device including a driver is avaiable in [TNLC dev. PCB](https://github.com/BielakM/polarimeter_DEMO/blob/master/TNLC%20dev.%20PCB).
